this code is written in python . Thus use latest version of python to run it
you may face many error during compilation, that's not my fault
you confirm that 
1.pyttsx3
2.random
3.speech_recognition 
4.wikipedia
5.datetime
6.time
7.getpass
8.pywhatkit
9.webbrowser
10.os
11.smtplib
These packages ar installed within your computer
and if it's not the you should try using
#pip install (package name).
Must note that pip is installed within your computer and updated.
You may still face a major error during runtime of speech recognition
the package of speech recognition also make problem
then , try #pip install SpeechRecognition
Then a runtime error may occur of PyAudio
then you should install a package of unofficial binaries from
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio
and download a .whl file named "PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.whl" for 64bit architecture machine
and "PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win32.whl" for 32bit architecture machine.
and try installing them in your api or command prompt
using python install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win_amd64.wh
or python install PyAudio‑0.2.11‑cp310‑cp310‑win32.whl
or you can use python3 to run instead of python
and if any error occurs then download pipwin by
#pip install pipwin
and then try pipwin install the .whl file.
Hope it will work fine.
Any issues you can mail me royarpan28@protonmail.com
happy 5th Gen
